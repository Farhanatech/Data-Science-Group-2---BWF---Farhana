# Real-Time Emotion Detection Project

## Description
This project implements a real-time emotion detection system using a deep learning model. When you run the code, a camera will open to detect faces and predict emotions based on facial expressions. The system does not save any video; it only processes the live feed to identify emotions.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- FER2013 Dataset (Facial Expression Recognition 2013)

## Installation Instructions
1. Download the project files from:
   [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Farhanatech/Data-Science-Group-2---BWF---Farhana)

2. Open Jupyter Notebook on your computer:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook

## Usage Instructions
In the Jupyter interface, open the Emotion Detection.ipynb file.

Run the cells. A camera window will open, detecting faces in real-time and predicting emotions.

Press 'q' to exit the camera feed.

## Further Steps
Ensure your webcam is functioning properly.
Modify the model or training dataset for improved accuracy if desired.
